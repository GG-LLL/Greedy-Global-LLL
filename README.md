# Greedy-Global-LLL

Implementations of Greedy-Global variants of LLL-style algorithms. The descriptions of the files that can be found in this repository are listed below.

- common.cpp &ensp; common.h &ensp; individual_basis_reduction.cpp  
For a given input basis, the functions contained here may be used to run one of the 9 basis reduction algorithms listed in our paper.

- generate_SVP_basis.cpp  
Can be used to generate SVP Challenge style bases. 

- collate.cpp  
Can be used to collate the results from multiple output files in one place.

- SVP_Bases &ensp; SVP_Outputs  
The input bases are contained in the zip file SVP_Bases, while their respective outputs are contained within SVP_Outputs.

- Averages  
This folder contains the summaries reported in our paper.
